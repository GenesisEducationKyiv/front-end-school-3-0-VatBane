## ADR-0001: enhancement of reliability and maintainability by improving type safety 
Date: 29-05-2025

### Status: Proposed

### Context

There is a lot of code which contains `any` type without direct annotations or type
narrowing, which already cause a lot of misunderstanding. 
It makes harder and slower to implement new features and potentially 
can cause unexpected errors.
Besides there are also a lot of type aliases where fields are different 
depending on some field or condition.
Because of it code is less readable and more complex

### Decision

- At least use `unknown` instead of `any`
- implement type narrowing and type guards
- use discriminated types where possible
- probably use "wll-known" libraries which implement common type guards
- enable `strict` mode

### Consequences

Positive: 
- more reliable code
- more readable code
- more obvious behaviour

Negative:
- demand of time to refactor existing code
- require time to make research
